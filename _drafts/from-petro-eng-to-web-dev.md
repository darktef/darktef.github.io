## Background

explain the life as a petroleum engineer
traditional industry, lots of money, but very conservative in terms of keeping up the pace of technology
sometimes, labor intensive?!

## The Switch
little intro
### Research
quit the job and do the research about what exactly I wanna do, and how I gonna acquire these types of skills in the fastest fashion
the reason behind local bootcamp => NETWORKING!
### Bootcamp
- what I learnt
- how I learnt
- project => portfolio and teamwork
- the resource I used to improve my understanding and expand my horizon
  + codecademy
  + SO
  + rubymonk
  + rubykoan
  + railscast
  + doc!!!

### Job Hunting
hundreds of application sent out
did several phone interviews, mostly focus on front-end
networking finally leads to the opportunity

### Intern
- reflect on things I did wrong, did not interact with people enough but only focus on work
- things I did right, take on responsibility on small things, communicate proactively regarding to task process and deadline, do write quality code, believe in myself

### Full-time
you should never stop
- the pragmatic programmer
- Rails pattern by sandi metz
- avid grimm

## Cont.
If I have to redo this again, what I will do differently.
- really learn JS & maybe jQuery
