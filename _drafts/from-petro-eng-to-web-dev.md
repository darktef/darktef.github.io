It is not easy to make the switch, I wanna share my experience with you, hope you will find something useful to you. Feel free to skip some of the sections and jump back to the section you are most interested.

## Background - Why I make the switch?

Career change is usually not a easy choice, especially when I already spent 7 years in school to study the same major. But it is not a sudden flash of intuition, I have been thinking about doing something related to coding since my first exposure with programming on my junior year. 

Life gets busy, and you always have tons of excuse to postpone other things. I chose to focus on graduation and getting a job as soon as possible, concerned about the depression the whole industry was suffering at that time.

It was not easy to get a job in oil and gas back then, and still not easy two years later. I managed to get a field job at a small startup, and started the life in the west Texas. 

__You never know what you do not want until you try it.__ I thought the field life will give me a lots of experience, and it did, but I am not happy. The life in the field is tough, you need to dealt with the harsh environment and figure out how to balance your life. It feels very disconnected with the rest of the world, I was concerned about how the future gonna turn out for me.

I clearly knows that I have a passion for technology, and probably not very passionate about most oil and gas stuff. I picked the oil and gas because of its lucrative future. The slip of oil price shaken the whole industry, and also my faith in the career. It seems like a perfect time to make the switch. __It is Now or never.__

Career change is a very personal choice, and depends on the financial situation at that time. I am very fortunate to have the luxury to make the change with the support from my family. I would not have done that with them. That been said, not everyone should just jump into another career without careful thoughts and considerat.

## The Switch - Do your work!

If you gonna do it, you better do it right. This applies to career change as well. Failure happens, but you want to make sure you did whatever you should before you really fail. __Every step aiming towards success counts.__

I quit my job, though keeping the job could provide some psychological cushion while I am making the change. But been away from the city is not helpful for finding your next opportunity, at least for me.

I started to research what kind of IT job I want to get at the end of day. Software developer and data analytic are the most common ones. Big data is new sexy, and possibly the future. Software developer has been there for a while, and will probably be there for a long long time. 

The easiest way for me to get into another career without any background is to get some sort of short-term fast-track training. It is exactly what I did, coding bootcamp.

Some people might chose to practice the common coding exercise for entering IT industry, and it works for them. I did not went for that route due to two reasons. One, I want to find a job at Dallas, where the interviews is not always technical heavy. Two, I would love to have some sort of community support and knowing that you are not alone in that path is very beneficial psychologically. Everybody is different. __Pick whatever works for you is the key.__

The best data related bootcamps are either at New York City or San Francisco. There is only three bootcamps in Dallas, and they all teach about web development. I did not have a strong preference for either of them at that time, both are interesting and challenging. So I went for the web development track.

To pick the bootcamp is not easy, the tuition and the service they offer all count. I reckon that __networking and project__ are the two most important aspects I am looking for.

The most important benefit of attending a local bootcamp is that you have the opportunity to get in touch with the local startup. Nowadays, having a connection could really make a difference. My connection actually introduced me to my first job. 

## Bootcamp - External help to speed up your process

### Overview

Language: Ruby, Javascript, HTML and CSS;
Framework(library): Rails, jQuery, and Sass (actually the pre-compiler);
Database: SQL.

To build a small web app locally, you need a database(SQLite, PostgresSQL, MySQL) to store all the data, a back-end/api(Rails, Django, Sinatra) to acquire different data and supplement to front-end at different endpoint, the last but not the least, a front-end to present the web app in terms of layout(HTML & CSS), style(CSS) and user interactions(JS).

### Environment

The bootcamp I went started with setting up the environment first. You could use Cloud9 to safely skip this step, or follow the tutorial step by step. This is a such complicated topic, and it is more a DevOp's expertise. I would not suggest spending too much time on this if you are a beginner or your interest is not in DevOp.

### Language

Your first step into the coding/programing will always be learning syntax. Be it Ruby, Javascript, HTML or CSS, they all start with following the rules. These are some really nice and __free__ resources I used when I did the homework for the bootcamp:

- CodeCademy: You could learn and practise Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL and much more here. It is an interactive environment, so think it as a gaming environment, just crushing down each level, and you will acquire the skills you want.
- RubyKoan: Use __test driven approaches__ to show every facet of Ruby, and explained some of the most confused concepts in action.
- RubyMonk: Attempt to cover every aspect of Ruby and challenges you with tons of coding questions. From beginner to expert level, it has all the material for you to become an Ruby expert.

### Framework

Enough for the language part, I am sure you are smart and diligent enough to find the material you need to master the language. Next, shall we get to the meaty part of web development?

With the modern framework, you could literally build a small to-do app in less than an hour. For example, Ruby on Rails, known for its black magic, does a lots of thing behind the theme.

Though it is using Rails 2 or 3, Ryan Bates' Railscast is always the best tutorial for understanding how rails work under the hood. 

And one more very important but easy to overlook material is Ruby on Rails doc. They does a really great job in documentation, anything you have doubt with, or any basic concept that you could not grasp. Read the doc, try out by yourself, if you still could not get it, repeat the cycle. Every word in the doc counts.


### Database
  

- project => portfolio and teamwork

Having project ready during the time in bootcamp, will prepare you for the future interview and build the foundation for your portfolio.

## Job Hunting - Into the real world
hundreds of application sent out
did several phone interviews, mostly focus on front-end
networkinfinally leads to the opportunity

## Intern - Demonstrate yourself
- reflect on things I did wrong, did not interact with people enough but only focus on work
- things I did right, take on responsibility on small things, communicate proactively regarding to task process and deadline, do write quality code, believe in myself

## Full-time - Enjoy the life
you should never stop
- the pragmatic programmer
- Rails pattern by sandi metz
- avid grimm

## Cont.
If I have to redo this again, what I will do differently.
- really learn JS & maybe jQuery
