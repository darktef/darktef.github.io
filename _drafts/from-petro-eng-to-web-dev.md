### Background - Why I make the switch?

Career change is usually not a easy choice, especially when I already spent 7 years in school to study the same major. But it is not a sudden flash of intuition, I have been thinking about doing something related to coding since my first exposure with programming on my junior year. 

Life gets busy, and you always have tons of excuse to postpone other things. I chose to focus on graduation and getting a job as soon as possible, concerned about the depression the whole industry was suffering at that time.

It was not easy to get a job in oil and gas back then, and still not easy two years later. I managed to get a field job at a small startup, and started the life in the west Texas. 

__You never know what you do not want until you try it.__ I thought the field life will give me a lots of experience, and it did, but I am not happy. The life in the field is tough, you need to dealt with the harsh environment and figure out how to balance your life. It feels very disconnected with the rest of the world, I was concerned about how the future gonna turn out for me.

I clearly knows that I have a passion for technology, and probably not very passionate about most oil and gas stuff. I picked the oil and gas because of its lucrative future. The slip of oil price shaken the whole industry, and also my faith in the career. It seems like a perfect time to make the switch. __Now or never.__

Career change is a very personal choice, and depends on the financial situation at that time. I am very fortunate to have the luxury to make the change with the support from my family. I would not have done that with them.

### The Switch - Do your work!

If you gonna do it, you better do it right. This applies to career change as well. Failure happens, but you want to make sure you did whatever you should before you really fail. Every step aiming towards success counts.

I quit my job, thought it could provide some psychological cushion while I am making the change. But been away from the city is not helpful for finding your next opportunity, at least for me.

I started to research what kind of IT job I want to get at the end of day. Software developer and data analytic are the most common ones. Big data is new sexy, and possibly the future. Software developer has been there for a while, and will probably be there for a long long time. 

The easiest way for me to get into another career without any background is to get some sort of short term training. It is exactly what I did, bootcamp.

Some people might chose to practice the common coding exercise for entering IT industry, and it works for them. I did not went for that route due to two reasons. One, I want to find a job at Dallas, where the interviews is not always technical heavy. Two, I would love to have some sort of community support and knowing that you are not alone in that path is very beneficial psychologically. Everybody is different. __Pick whatever works for you is the key.__

The best data related bootcamps are either at New York City or San Francisco. There is only three bootcamp in Dallas, and they all teach about web development. I did not have a strong preference for either of them at that time, both are interesting and challenging. So I went for the web development track.

To pick the bootcamp is not easy, the tuition and the service they offer all count. I reckon that __networking and project__ are the two most important aspects I am looking for.

The most important benefit of attending a local bootcamp is that you have the opportunity to get in touch with the local startup. Having project ready during the time in bootcamp, will prepare you for the future interview and build the foundation for your portfolio.

quit the job and do the research about what exactly I wanna do, and how I gonna acquire these types of skills in the fastest fashion
the reason behind local bootcamp => NETWORKING!

### Bootcamp - External help to speed up your process
- what I learn and how I learn
  

- project => portfolio and teamwork
- the resource I used to improve my understanding and expand my horizon
  + codecademy
  + SO
  + rubymonk
  + rubykoan
  + railscast
  + doc!!!

### Job Hunting - Into the real world
hundreds of application sent out
did several phone interviews, mostly focus on front-end
networking finally leads to the opportunity

### Intern - Demonstrate yourself
- reflect on things I did wrong, did not interact with people enough but only focus on work
- things I did right, take on responsibility on small things, communicate proactively regarding to task process and deadline, do write quality code, believe in myself

### Full-time - Enjoy the life
you should never stop
- the pragmatic programmer
- Rails pattern by sandi metz
- avid grimm

## Cont.
If I have to redo this again, what I will do differently.
- really learn JS & maybe jQuery
