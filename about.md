Hey! I am a Junior Web Developer, based in Dallas, TX. I completed 8wk coding bootcamp at Tech Talent South and learnt Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other core concepts of full-stack web development. For the past 7 years, I studied and worked in petroleum engineering, which exposed me to many interesting technologies including offshore drilling rig simulation and other drilling automation techniques. I am always facinated about how much technology is capable of achieving. Rather than remaining on the sidelines, watching technology happen, I want to build it! It is my aspiration to push the limits of my technical capabilities and leave a valuable mark on the world! I enjoy writing neat code, experimenting new technologies and challenging myself.
